Show transactions as a table

Handle IO errors (including non-200 responses). Perhaps just display the error on the screen
Refresh transactions
Use delta when refreshing transactions, to get only the ones that have changed
Persist cached data to file, so app doesn't have to load all transactions every time it starts

improve column widths. Ideas:
  weighed column widths
  max column widths (e.g. we know that date never needs more than 10 chars)
  column widths automatically adjust to content

term.go is complex enough to need its own tests. Also consider "converting" bytes to runes as they come
